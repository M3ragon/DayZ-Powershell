# DayZ-Powershell
A script to start, stop and update your DayZ server in Powershell.<br>

I'm learning PowerShell and using my DayZ server as a test subject. I hate it then in all public scripts the mods are in a line and 99% still use CMD/Bat files.<br>

So I am working on my PowerShell here.<br>

The script is far from perfect, but it does what it should!<br>
~~On a side note, DZSA is a cramp.~~
